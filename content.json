That's because those who are struggling grew up without any expectation of fairness. It's a different story from Europe, for example, where equal opportunity has always been a stated goal of politicians. Ultimately, envy is the downside of being let down by a society you believed was fair. "

      "intro": "<p><i>Wed 3 Dec 2025</i></p><p><strong>To avoid brooding, which is a form of negative and repetitive thinking (rumination), you can use distraction, mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral techniques.</strong><br>These exercises help break the cycle of unproductive thoughts and shift your focus toward the present.</strong></p><p><strong>Acknowledge and label thoughts</strong><br> When you notice yourself starting to brood, simply label the thought without judgment. For example, say to yourself, \"That's a 'worry' thought,\" or \"I'm ruminating again.\" This creates distance between you and your thoughts, reminding you that they are just mental events, not facts.</p><p><strong>Practice \"Leaves on a Stream\"</strong><br>Visualize yourself sitting by a stream and placing each negative or repetitive thought on a leaf floating by. Watch it float away without chasing it. This exercise teaches you to observe your thoughts without getting caught up in them.</p><p><strong>Focus on your senses</strong><br>Engage your five senses to ground yourself in the present moment. <blockquote><i>Name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.</i></blockquote><br>This technique is especially useful during moments of intense worry.</p><p><strong>Practice mindful breathing</strong><br>Pay close attention to the sensation of your breath as you inhale and exhale. When your mind starts to wander, gently redirect your focus back to your breathing.</p>",
